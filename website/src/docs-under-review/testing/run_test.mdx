## Running a Unit Test

To run unit tests locally, we can do the following:

1. Build and run the mapping tool locally, where the `.env` file should
   contain the credentials for the dev DB.

```
docker build --tag ccom . && docker run -it --volume $PWD/api:/api
   --env-file .env -p 8080:8000 ccom
```

2. In another terminal tab, run the following the get the name of the
   running container and open a shell within it (be careful here if
   you have more than one container running in docker! - It just grabs
   the first container in the list)

```
docker exec -it `docker container ls | awk 'NR==2 {print $1}'` /bin/bash
```

3. Then run the following commands in the container:

```
cd ../api
python manage.py test mapping
```
