# Security Guidelines

This document outlines security and infrastructure recommendations for deploying and running Carrot Mapper within a network. 

## Container Images 

- Carrot Mapper should be deployed using container images to ensure consistency and security. 
- Carrot Mapper should be regularly updated to the latest stable release.
- Organisations can build their own image from source if required.

## Version Pinning

- Carrot Mapper containers should be pinned to a specific tagged version for stability. 
- Using tagged versions ensures that you are deploying a known, tested version of the software, which helps in maintaining a stable and predictable environment. 
- You can find a list of available version tags in the [container registry](https://github.com/orgs/Health-Informatics-UoN/packages?repo_name=carrot-mapper).

## Networking

- Carrot Mapper should be deployed within a private subnet for isolation from other services.

## Configuration

- Carrot Mapper credentials for databases and APIs should be stored in a secrets service.

## Monitoring
- Carrot Mapper logs should be forwarded to a centralised logging system.
- Alerts should be set up for failed queries and excessive errors.
- Container health checks and external monitoring should be used to ensure Carrot Mapper is running as expected.

## Data Access
- Database credentials used by Carrot Mapper should be limited to the minimum required permissions, only read-only (select) access to the OMOP CDM database schema is required.
