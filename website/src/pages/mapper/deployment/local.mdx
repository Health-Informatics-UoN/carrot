# Deploy Carrot Mapper

This page will guide you through getting Carrot Mapper deployed in a Virtual Machine (VM) or locally on your machine.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ¥•">
  We provide Carrot Mapper's [container
  registry](https://github.com/orgs/Health-Informatics-UoN/packages?repo_name=carrot-mapper)
  for ease of deployment.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- A VM with these apps installed
  - [Docker](https://knowledgebase.aridhia.io/workspaces/analysing-data/virtual-machines/installing-software-on-virtual-machines/installing-docker-on-your-virtual-machine) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - [wget](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wget-command-with-examples#:~:text=wget%20is%20a%20free%20GNU,this%20tutorial%20uses%20Ubuntu%2022.04)

## Deployment Steps

<Steps>

### Get the example Compose file

Download the [sample Carrot Mapper Compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot/refs/heads/main/samples/Carrot-Mapper/compose/mapper.compose.yml) file by running the command:

```bash copy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot/refs/heads/main/samples/Carrot-Mapper/compose/mapper.compose.yml
```

### Environment configuration

For your convenience, the compose file is already configured with enough environment variables to run Carrot Mapper. For the reference, please see the [Configuration section](/mapper/deployment/configuration).

### OMOP CDM configuration

Before getting Carrot Mapper running, you need to configure the OMOP CDM in its database.

By default, Carrot Mapper uses a synthetic OMOP CDM database which will be then loaded into the database thanks to the `omop-lite` service. If you want to use your own vocabularies in the OMOP CDM, you need to:

- Set the `SYNTHETIC` environment variable of the `omop-lite` service to `false` in the `mapper.compose.yml` file.

```yaml copy
SYNTHETIC: false
```

- Create a folder named `vocabs` in the same directory as the `mapper.compose.yml` file.
- Download the desired vocabularies from [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/) and place them in the `vocabs` folder.

## Running Carrot Mapper

To run Carrot, you need to specify the release version of the Carrot Mapper application you want to deploy. You can find the list of available versions in the [container registry](https://github.com/orgs/Health-Informatics-UoN/packages?repo_name=carrot-mapper).

At the directory containing the `mapper.compose.yml` file, run the command with the release version specified:

```bash copy
RELEASE_VERSION=<release-version> docker compose up -d
```

The command will pull and build the following services:

- Frontend: `frontend`
- Backend: `api`
- Database: `db`
- Minio: `minio`
- Airflow Webserver: `airflow-webserver`
- Airflow Scheduler: `scheduler`
- OMOP Lite: `omop-lite` - This service will load the vocabularies into the database depending on how you configured it in the last step. After the vocabularies are loaded, `api` service will be started, then `frontend`, `airflow-webserver` and `scheduler`.

After the services are up and running successfully, you can access the Carrot Mapper frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000`. Default admin credentials are `admin` and `admin`.

Please follow meantioned in step 5 of dev's quickstart to [create first instances](/mapper/dev_guide/quickstart#first-instances-creation) of Carrot Mapper.

You can also access the Airflow webserver at `http://localhost:8080` to monitor the DAGs running. Default admin credentials are `admin` and `admin`.

Try using Carrot by steps in the [user quickstart](/mapper/user_guide/quickstart) to see if Carrot is running correctly. If you can successfully upload a new scan report, create mapping rules, and finally can export the Mapping rules JSON. That's a sign that you have successfully install and run Carrot locally.

## Best Practices

When deploying Carrot Mapper, follow these best practices to ensure stability and consistency:

- Use Tagged Versions: We tag each container image with a version number upon release. Always deploy a specific tagged version rather than latest to avoid unintended updates.
- Check Available Versions: You can find a list of available version tags in the [container registry](https://github.com/orgs/Health-Informatics-UoN/packages?repo_name=carrot-mapper).
- Environment Configuration: Ensure your deployment environment (for example database connections, API endpoints) is correctly configured via environment variables.
- Monitor and Log: Use logging and monitoring tools to track service health and quickly diagnose issues.
