# Kubernetes Deployment

Carrot Mapper can be deployed on Kubernetes using manifests or Helm charts. We're very early in our Kubernetes journey, so welcome feedback and patience as our documentation emerges.

## Kubernetes Manifests

Sample Kubernetes manifest files for Carrot Mapper are available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot/tree/main/samples/Carrot-Mapper/k8s).

## Helm Charts

We publish Helm charts for Carrot Mapper as [OCI releases](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot/pkgs/container/charts%2Fcarrot-mapper). The source for these charts is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot/tree/main/charts/carrot-mapper).

To install the chart using Helm, run:

```bash copy
helm install carrot-mapper oci://ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon/charts/carrot-mapper --version 0.1.0
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ¥•">
    This is our first version of the Helm chart. Weâ€™ll soon publish more detailed guidance on using `values.yaml` to customise your installation.
</Callout>

Once installed, you can port-forward the `carrot-mapper-frontend` pod to access it locally.

Because Carrot Mapper depends on an existing OMOP CDM in your database, the Helm install will create one and populate it with a small sample of vocabulary data.
For full functionality, youâ€™ll currently need to rebuild this OMOP CDM in your database using a complete set of vocabularies downloaded from Athena, as described in the [requirements](requirements).

Weâ€™re actively working to make this process smoother and to support populating the OMOP CDM with complete vocabularies during installation, and the ability to update the Vocabularies.
