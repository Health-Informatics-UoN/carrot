# Kubernetes Deployment

Carrot Mapper is deployable on Kubernetes.. 

## Kubernetes Manifests

Sample Kubernetes manifests files are available for Carrot Mapper in our [Github](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot/tree/main/samples/Carrot-Mapper/k8s).

## Helm Charts

We publish Helm Charts for Carrot as [releases](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot/pkgs/container/charts%2Fcarrot-mapper), you can also find the source code in our [Github](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot/tree/main/charts/carrot-mapper).

To install these charts using Helm, run:

```bash copy
helm install carrot-mapper oci://ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon/charts/carrot-mapper --version 0.1.0
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ¥•">
    This is our first version of Helm charts, and we'll soon be publishing further guidance on configuration using `values.yaml` to customise your install.
</Callout>

You can then port-forward the `carrot-mapper-frontend` pod to gain access locally.

As Carrot Mapper has a dependency on an OMOP CDM existing in a database, the helm install will create one and populate it with a small sample of the vocabularies data.
For full functionality, you would currently need to remake this OMOP CDM in the database with a set of Vocabularies downloaded from Athena as outlined in the [requirements](requirements).

We're working on making the process smoother, and enabling a user to populate the OMOP CDM with complete Vocabularies during the install process.
