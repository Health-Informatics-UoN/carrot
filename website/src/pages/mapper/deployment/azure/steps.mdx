# Azure Deployment Steps

This page will guide you through some high-level steps required to deploy Carrot Mapper on Azure.

## Resources Creation

Let's start by create some Azure resource for Carrot:

<Steps>

### Resource group

If you didn't do so, create a resource group which holds related resources for an Azure solution.

Choose a suitable `Subscription`, `Region` and a name for your `Resource group`.

### Web apps

Four web apps will need creating: One for Backend, one for Frontend, two for Airflow.

**Basics**

Choose a suitable `Subscription`, `Resource group`, `Region`, `Pricing plan`, and a name for your Web app.

Publish mode and Operating system should be `Container` and `Linux`, respectively.

**Container**

Choose `Other container registries` as `Image source`.

For `Docker hub options`, setup as below:

<Tabs items={['Frontend app', 'Backend app', 'Airflow Scheduler', 'Airflow Webserver']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Access type: `Public`

Registry server URL:

```bash
ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon
```

Image and tag:

```bash
carrot/frontend:<tag>
```

You can choose a version of this container by using the tag for the image. Look for available tags [here](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper/pkgs/container/carrot%2Ffrontend).

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

Access type: `Public`

Registry server URL:

```bash
ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon
```

Image and tag:

```bash
carrot/backend:<tag>
```

You can choose a version of this container by using the tag for the image. Look for available tags [here](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper/pkgs/container/carrot%2Fbackend).

  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>

Access type: `Public`

Registry server URL:

```bash
ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon
```

Image and tag:

```bash
carrot/airflow-webserver:<tag>
```

You can choose a version of this container by using the tag for the image. Look for available tags [here](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper/pkgs/container/carrot%2Fbackend).

  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>

Access type: `Public`

Registry server URL:

```bash
ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon
```

Image and tag:

```bash
carrot/airflow-scheduler:<tag>
```

You can choose a version of this container by using the tag for the image. Look for available tags [here](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper/pkgs/container/carrot%2Fbackend).

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

**Networking**: As default.

**Monitor + Secure**: We recommend Application Insights to be enabled.

**Tags**: Give name and value for the web app's tag, if needed.


### PostgreSQL Database

If you didn't have one, create a PostgreSQL Database on Azure.

Follow prompted steps to create a suitable Database for Carrot.

### Data Factory

Data factory is useful when creating workflows/scripts to load and manage data on Azure storage and Azure database.

Create one following the prompted steps.

### Key vault

Key vault is highly recommended to keep secrets and keys for functioning Carrot safe. If you didn't have one, create a Key Vault following the prompted steps on Azure.

</Steps>

## Preparation

You will need to prepare your database and storage before configure other apps.

<Steps>

### Database

Using Data factory or other ways to create a schema named `omop` in your database, then load there the vocabularies, which you would like to be in Carrot, downloaded from [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/). The guide for downloading can be found [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/General-Structure,-Download-and-Use).

### Storage

You need to decide which storage you would like to use for Carrot.

Carrot will create the required resources such as Containers based on the `STORAGE_TYPE` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 

</Steps>

## Configuration

Below are some important steps to configure created apps making them working together smoothly. More details and Azure examples can be found on [Configuration](/mapper/dev_guide/deployment/configuration) section.

<Steps>

### Backend app

Navigate to `Environment variables` section under `Settings` of your Backend web app, then add the variables below:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Key</Th>
      <Th>Description</Th>
    </Tr>

      <Td>The URL of your Frontend app.</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>`ALLOWED_HOSTS`</Td>
      <Td>
        A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this Django
        site can serve. Put here the URL of your Backend app and `localhost`.

    </Tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>


**Restart your app** for the environment variables to be applied, and then create the first instances in Carrot by the following steps:

  1. **Access the Admin Panel** using the URL: `<backend-URL>/admin/`, log in using the superuser credentials in the `Environment variables` section.

  2. Create first instance of `Data partner`, `Dataset`, and `Project`.


### Frontend app

Navigate to `Environment variables` section under `Settings` of your Frontend web app, then add the variables below:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Key</Th>
      <Th>Description</Th>
    </Tr>
  </thead>

        `NEXTAUTH_BACKEND_URL`
      </Td>
      <Td>
        The backend base endpoint URL where `Frontend` send auth requests to. Put here: `<backendUrl>/api/`
      </Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>
        {" "}
        `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
      </Td>
      <Td>
        Used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT, and to hash email verification
        tokens. Choose a
        complex key for this. It is recommended to put this in the Key Vault.
      </Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>
        {" "}
        `NEXTAUTH_URL`
      </Td>
      <Td>The base URL where login and logout processes point to. Put here the URL of the Frontend web app</Td>
    </Tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Airflow Scheduler app

Navigate to `Environment variables` section under `Settings` of your Function app, then add the variables below:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Key</Th>
      <Th>Description</Th>
    </Tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>`SECRET_KEY`</Td>
      <Td>
        Same value with `SECRET_KEY` in Backend app. It is recommended to put
        this in the Key Vault.
      </Td>
    </Tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Key vault

Set up your key vault by generate Keys/Secrets under `Objects` of your Key vault app.
Give your secret a name and add there the value of the secret.

You would also need to set up the `Access policies` of your Key vault: Add there Applications and Users, along with their permissions to access the vault. If you find it hard to search for a specific object while creating access policy, search by the object ID which can be generated by `Identity` under `Settings` of the application.

To use secrets in Key vault, change the value of the important environment variables to:

```bash
@Microsoft.KeyVault(VaultName=<key-vault-name>;SecretName=<secret-name>)
```

After that, you need to click `Pull reference values` which is located on top of the `Environment variables` page to apply the values in the Key vault to your environment.

</Steps>

## Testing

To test if Carrot is deployed successfully on Azure, open the URL of the Frontend app, then log in using admin credentials. If you can upload a scan report, add some manual and automatic Concepts, and download Mapping rules files successfuly, that's a sign that Carrot now can be used.
