# Azure Deployment Steps

This page will guide you through some high-level steps required to deploy Carrot Mapper on Azure.

## Resources Creation

Let's start by create some Azure resource for Carrot:

<Steps>

### Resource group

If you didn't do so, create a resource group which holds related resources for an Azure solution.

Choose a suitable `Subscription`, `Region` and a name for your `Resource group`.

### Web apps

Two web apps will need creating: One for Backend and another for Frontend.

**Basics**

Choose a suitable `Subscription`, `Resource group`, `Region`, `Pricing plan`, and a name for your Web app.

Publish mode and Operating system should be `Container` and `Linux`, respectively.

**Container**

Choose `Other container registries` as `Image source`.

For `Docker hub options`, setup as below:

<Tabs items={['Frontend app', 'Backend app']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Access type: `Public`

Registry server URL:

```bash
ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon
```

Image and tag:

```bash
carrot/frontend:<tag>
```

You can choose a version of this container by using the tag for the image. Look for available tags [here](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper/pkgs/container/carrot%2Ffrontend).

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

Access type: `Public`

Registry server URL:

```bash
ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon
```

Image and tag:

```bash
carrot/backend:<tag>
```

You can choose a version of this container by using the tag for the image. Look for available tags [here](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper/pkgs/container/carrot%2Fbackend).

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

**Networking**: As default.

**Monitor + Secure**: We recommend Application Insights to be enabled.

**Tags**: Give name and value for the web app's tag, if needed.

### Function app

Choose `App service` when prompted.

**Basics**

Choose a suitable `Subscription`, `Resource group`, `Region`, `Pricing plan`, and a name for your Function app.

Select `Container Image` as the mode of deploying.

**Storage**: Choose or create an Azure storage where the Function app will store its Blobs and Queues.

**Networking**: As default.

**Monitor + Secure**: We recommend Application Insights to be enabled.

**Tags**: Give name and value for the web app's tag, if needed.

**Container Image**: A default image will be used as you create a function app. Therefore, after the app being deployed you must change this image by doing so:

- Access the newly created Function app.
- Under tab `Deployment`, choose `Deployment center`.
- Choose `Private Registry` as Registry source.
- Change Server URL to: `https://ghcr.io`.
- Change Full Image Name and Tag to: `health-informatics-uon/carrot/workers:<tag>`. Look for available tags [here](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper/pkgs/container/carrot%2Fworkers).
- Save the Settings.


### PostgreSQL Database

If you didn't have one, create a PostgreSQL Database on Azure.

Follow prompted steps to create a suitable Database for Carrot.

### Data Factory

Data factory is useful when creating workflows/scripts to load and manage data on Azure storage and Azure database.

Create one following the prompted steps.

### Key vault

Key vault is highly recommended to keep secrets and keys for functioning Carrot safe. If you didn't have one, create a Key Vault following the prompted steps on Azure.

</Steps>

## Preparation

You will need to prepare your database and storage before configure other apps.

<Steps>

### Database

Using Data factory or other ways to create a schema named `omop` in your database, then load there the vocabularies, which you would like to be in Carrot, downloaded from [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/). The guide for downloading can be found [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/General-Structure,-Download-and-Use).

### Storage

You need to decide which storage and queue you would like to use for Carrot.

Carrot will create the required resources such as Containers and Queues based on the `STORAGE_TYPE` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 

</Steps>

## Configuration

Below are some important steps to configure created apps making them working together smoothly. More details and Azure examples can be found on [Configuration](/mapper/dev_guide/deployment/configuration) section.

<Steps>

  </tbody>
</Table>

### Key vault

Set up your key vault by generate Keys/Secrets under `Objects` of your Key vault app.
Give your secret a name and add there the value of the secret.

You would also need to set up the `Access policies` of your Key vault: Add there Applications and Users, along with their permissions to access the vault. If you find it hard to search for a specific object while creating access policy, search by the object ID which can be generated by `Identity` under `Settings` of the application.

To use secrets in Key vault, change the value of the important environment variables to:

```bash
@Microsoft.KeyVault(VaultName=<key-vault-name>;SecretName=<secret-name>)
```

After that, you need to click `Pull reference values` which is located on top of the `Environment variables` page to apply the values in the Key vault to your environment.

</Steps>

## Testing

To test if Carrot is deployed successfully on Azure, open the URL of the Frontend app, then log in using admin credentials. If you can upload a scan report, add some manual and automatic Concepts, and download Mapping rules files successfuly, that's a sign that Carrot now can be used.

  Congratulations on your first Carrot running on Azure!
