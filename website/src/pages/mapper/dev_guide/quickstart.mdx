# Developer Quickstart

This page will guide you through getting Carrot running locally.

Start by cloning [the Carrot Mapper repository](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Vocabularies downloaded from [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/). The guide for downloading can be found [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/General-Structure,-Download-and-Use).

<Callout type="info">
  For a quick start, we don't recommend downloading and importing all of the available vocabularies on Athena, which will make the Carrot installation slower. Instead, the list below suggests **minimum required vocabularies** for Carrot's quick start. 
</Callout>

**Minimum Required Vocabularies**
  <div>
    For downloading the minimum required vocabularies, you can use the following:
    <div>
      - SNOMED CT
      - RxNorm
      - RxNorm Extension
      - LOINC
      - ICD10
      - ICD10CM
      - Gender
      - Ethnicity
      - OMOP Extension
      - NHS Ethnic Category
      - OPCS4
      - UK BioBank

## Getting Started

Below are steps to make Carrot up and running locally.

<Steps>

### OMOP schema and vocabs setting

You need a pre-seeded OMOP CDM database inside the database of Carrot.

To do this, add a folder named `vocabs` in the `root` directory of Carrot, then place there vocabulary files downloaded from Athena.

Thanks to [OMOP Lite](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/omop-lite) container, OMOP schema will be created and vocabularies will be loaded to Carrot's database, when the app's stack is running.

### Superuser Credentials setup
A superuser needs to be created to access the Django admin dashboard and Carrot frontend.

By default, the superuser credentials are:

```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

You can change those by doing the following steps:

    - Locate the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `root` directory of Carrot.
    - Change the following variables of the `api` service with your desired credentials:

      ```yaml
        - SUPERUSER_DEFAULT_USERNAME=<superuser_username>
        - SUPERUSER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=<superuser_password>
        - SUPERUSER_DEFAULT_EMAIL=<superuser_email>
      ```

    - After the [Warm up](#warm-up) step is done, a superuser will be created automatically with the credentials you chose above.


<Callout type="info">
  Without the superuser credentials in the environment variables, no users will be created. However, you can still add a superuser later by doing it manually (using the command `python manage.py createsuperuser` on the `api` container) or automatically (using steps above, and then restarting the containers).
</Callout>

### Warm up

At the `root` directory, run to command below to start the application stack using Docker compose.

```bash copy
docker compose --profile main up -d
```

**After running the `docker-compose`, Carrot runs the following containers below:**

- Database (`db`)
- MinIO  (`minio`) (default admin credentials are: `Username : minioadmin` and `Password : minioadmin`)
- Carrot's backend (`api`) 
- Airflow services (`airflow-webserver` and `scheduler`)
- Carrot's frontend (`frontend`).

This process will be on the background and take some time, but you can always check it through Docker Desktop app.

When all of containers, except `omop-lite`, are up and running successfully, Carrot's frontend and backend can be accessed through `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://localhost:8000/admin/` respectively.

**However**, please complete the remaining steps, while containers are running, to make sure Carrot is running correctly.

More details about Docker compose's configuration can be found [here](configuration).

<Callout type="info">

The `omop-lite` container, whose task is creating `omop` schema on `db` and install vocabularies there, will be shut down automatically after successfully done its jobs. The execution time for `omop-lite` may vary depending of the size of the Vocabs folder.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

Docker will mount the `app/api` and `app/next-client-app` directories to its environment, so any changes in the code of the backend or frontend will be reflected in the running application.

</Callout>

### First instances creation

Create some first instances in Carrot app by logging to Django Admin panel `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.

1. You can **log in to the Admin Panel** using the [superuser credentials](#superuser-credentials-setup) you configured earlier.
2. Once logged in, you will be presented with the Django Admin panel.
3. Following this order, fill out the required information to create new instance of `Data Partner`, `Dataset` and `Project`.

### Check-in

You should now be able to access Carrot by logging in at `http://localhost:3000/` using your admin credentials created at step 3.

After log in, you will be presented with `Projects` page.

Try using Carrot by steps in the [user quickstart](/mapper/user_guide/quickstart) to see if Carrot is running correctly. If you can successfully upload a new scan report, create mapping rules, and finally can export the Mapping rules JSON. That's a sign that you have successfully install and run Carrot locally.

<Callout emoji="ðŸŽ‰">Congratulations on your first Carrot running!</Callout>

</Steps>

Since now on, to run Carrot locally, you can just run

```bash copy
docker compose --profile main up -d
```

and access `http://localhost:3000/`.

To stop the application, run:

```bash copy
docker compose --profile main down
```
_Optional:_ There is another service, which is Azurite storage, that can be used in Carrot Mapper. To activate this service, run the command below instead to at step 4 - [Warm up](#warm-up) 

```bash copy
STORAGE_TYPE=azure docker compose --profile azure up -d
```
<Callout type='warning'>
**Note:** Changing the mode of starting the compose stack is not recommended, because this may cause the conflicts in storage.
</Callout>

**What next?** Explore and try using Carrot with [user quickstart](/mapper/user_guide/quickstart).
