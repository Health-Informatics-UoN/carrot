# Developer Quickstart

This page will guide you through getting Carrot running locally.

Start by cloning [the Carrot Mapper repository](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [MS Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/#Download-4)
- Vocabularies downloaded from [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/). The guide for downloading can be found [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/General-Structure,-Download-and-Use).

## Getting Started

Below are steps to make Carrot up and running locally.

<Steps>

### OMOP schema and vocabs setting

You need a pre-seeded OMOP CDM database inside the database of Carrot.

To do this, add a folder named `vocabs` in the `root` directory of Carrot, then place there vocabulary files downloaded from Athena.

Thanks to [OMOP Lite](https://github.com/andyrae/omop-lite/pkgs/container/omop-lite) container, OMOP schema will be created and vocabularies will be loaded to Carrot's database, when the app's stack is running.

### Authentication setup for Azure functions

For local development, an authentication will be required when `api` container sends requests to `workers` container,.

To set this up, at the `app/workers` directory, add a folder named `Secrets`. Inside this folder, add a new file named `rulestrigger.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "value": "rules_key",
      "encrypted": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Warm up

At the `root` directory, run to command below to start the application stack using Docker compose.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This runs the database (`db`), Azurite emulator (`Azurite`), Azure functions (`workers`) and will build Carrot's backend (`api`) and frontend (`frontend`). This process will be on the background and take some time, but you can always check it through Docker Desktop app.

When all of containers, except `omop-lite`, are up and running successfully, Carrot's frontend and backend can be accessed through `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://localhost:8000/admin/` respectively.

- **However**, please complete the remaining steps, while containers are running, to make sure Carrot running correctly.

More details about Docker compose's configuration can be found [here](configuration).

<Callout type="info">

The `omop-lite` container, whose task is creating `omop` schema on `db` and install vocabularies there, will be shut down automatically after successfully done its jobs.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

Docker will mount the `app/api` and `app/next-client-app` directories to its environment, so any changes in the code of the backend or frontend will be reflected in the running application.

</Callout>

### Initial data preparation

<Callout type="info" emoji="❗️"> Again, please wait for the omop-lite Container to Complete Execution. </Callout>

<div>
  - When running the Docker Compose for the first time, wait until the
  `omop-lite` container shuts down. **The execution time may vary depending on
  the size of the Vocabs folder**.
</div>

At this point, the remaining three containers will start running and will be prepared for the next steps:
<div>
- `carrot-workers`
- `carrot-frontend` (also referred to as `carrot-mapper-dev-frontend-1`)
- `carrot-backend` (also referred to as `carrot-mapper-dev-api-1`)
</div>
<Callout type="info">
  Once these containers are up and running, Carrot will proceed to the next
  steps.
</Callout>

**Following the containers are up and running, Carrot will proceed to the next steps.**

- **Automatic Data Seeding**: The system will automatically populate the required database tables and data when the application starts.

<div id="superuserCredentials">
- **Super User Creation**: A **default Django super user** will be created with the following credentials:
  <div>
  - **Username**: `admin`
  - **Password**: `Password123!`
  </div>
</div>

<Callout type="info">
  **However** if you want to{" "}
  <u>**create a new superuser with custom credentials**</u>, follow one of the
  methods below:
</Callout>

This can be done by **either using your terminal and access the `api` container on `Docker` or using `Docker Desktop`**.

<Tabs items={['Using Terminal', 'Using Docker Desktop']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  At the `root` directory, open terminal and run

```bash
docker exec -it carrot-mapper-dev-api-1 bash
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

Navigate to your Docker Desktop, under `carrot-mapper-dev`, choose `api` container, choose `Exec` tab, then run:

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

After that, add a new admin user (Django superuser) by running:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

This will allow you to create a new superuser with your desired credentials.

### First instances creation

Create some first instances in Carrot app by logging to Django Admin panel `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.

- Login can be done either using the default [superuser credentials](#superuserCredentials) or the new superuser credentials created in the previous step.

- Following this order, fill out the required information to create new `Data Partner`, `Dataset` and `Project`.

### Azure local storage setup

You need to set up an Azurite local storage for local development of Carrot

To do this, with the `workers` container in Docker Desktop is running, open `MS Azure Storage Explorer`, and create the following `queues` (under the tab `Storage Accounts - Emulator - Queues`) and `blob containers` (under the tab `Storage Accounts - Emulator - Blob Containers`).

<Tabs items={['Queues', 'Blob Containers']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```
rules-local
rules-exports-local
uploadreports-local
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```
scan-reports
data-dictionaries
rules-exports
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Check-in

You should now be able to access Carrot by logging in at `http://localhost:3000/` using your admin credentials created at step 4.

After log in, you will be presented with `Projects` page.

Try using Carrot by steps in the [user quickstart](/mapper/user_guide/quickstart) to see if Carrot is running correctly. If you can successfully upload a new scan report, create mapping rules, and finally can export the Mapping rules JSON. That's a sign that you have successfully install and run Carrot locally.

<Callout emoji="🎉">Congratulations on your first Carrot running!</Callout>

</Steps>

Since now on, to run Carrot locally, you can just run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

and access `http://localhost:3000/`.
