# Developer Quickstart

This page will guide you through getting Carrot running locally.

Start by cloning [the Carrot Mapper repository](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-mapper)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [MS Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/#Download-4)
- Vocabularies downloaded from [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/). The guide for downloading can be found [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/General-Structure,-Download-and-Use).

## Getting Started

Below are steps to make Carrot up and running locally.

<Steps>

### OMOP schema and vocabs setting

You need a pre-seeded OMOP CDM database inside the database of Carrot.

To do this, add a folder named `vocabs` in the `root` directory of Carrot, then place there vocabulary files downloaded from Athena.

Thanks to [OMOP Lite](https://github.com/andyrae/omop-lite/pkgs/container/omop-lite) container, OMOP schema will be created and vocabularies will be loaded to Carrot's database, when the app's stack is running.

### Authentication setup for Azure functions

For local development, an authentication will be required when `api` container sends requests to `workers` container,.

To set this up, at the `app/workers` directory, add a folder named `Secrets`. Inside this folder, add a new file named `rulestrigger.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "value": "rules_key",
      "encrypted": false
    }
  ]
}
```


### Superuser Credentials setup
A superuser needs to be created to access the Django admin dashboard and Carrot frontend.

To do that, superuser credentials need adding as environment variables by doing the following steps:

    - Locate the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `root` directory of Carrot.
    - Add the following variables to  the `environment` section of the `api` service:

      ```yaml
      environment:
        - SUPERUSER_DEFAULT_USERNAME=<superuser_username>
        - SUPERUSER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=<superuser_password>
        - SUPERUSER_DEFAULT_EMAIL=<superuser_email> // Defaulted to `user@carrot`
        - ...other variables
      ```

    - Replace `superuser_username`, `superuser_email`, and `superuser_password` with your desired credentials.
    - After the [Warm up](#warm-up) step is done, a superuser will be created automatically with the credentials you chose above.


<Callout type="info">
  Without the superuser credentials in the environment variables, no users will be created. However, you can still add a superuser later by doing it manually (using the command `python manage.py createsuperuser` on the `api` container) or automatically (using steps above, and then restarting the containers).
</Callout>

### Warm up

At the `root` directory, run to command below to start the application stack using Docker compose.

<div>
  <Tabs items={['MinIO' ]}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="MinIO">
      <div>

        ```bash
        STORAGE_TYPE=minio docker compose --profile minio up -d
        ```

        Since, we decided to use **MinIO as a storage**, Carrot will automatically create the necessary resources which are mentioned below:
        
        - **BLOB CONTAINERS** = [ `scan-reports`, `data-dictionaries`, `rules-exports` ]
        - **QUEUES** = [`rules-local`, `rules-exports-local`, `uploadreports-local` ]

        ---

      **[Optional]** - You can **check the created MinIO resources** by following the steps below:  

        1. Access the MinIO Console at http://localhost:9001

        2. Login to the MinIO Admin page using the following credentials below:

        ```
        Username : minioadmin

        Password : minioadmin
        ```

          3. You will be presented with the MinIO Console. You can check the created buckets by clicking on the `Buckets` tab.
      </div>
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>
---

**After running the `docker-compose`, Carrot runs the following containers below:**

- Database (`db`)
- Azurite emulator (`Azurite`)
- MinIO  (`minio`) if `STORAGE_TYPE` is `minio`
- Azure functions (`workers`)
- After that, it will build Carrot's backend (`api`) and frontend (`frontend`). 

This process will be on the background and take some time, but you can always check it through Docker Desktop app.

When all of containers, except `omop-lite`, are up and running successfully, Carrot's frontend and backend can be accessed through `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://localhost:8000/admin/` respectively.

**However**, please complete the remaining steps, while containers are running, to make sure Carrot is running correctly.

More details about Docker compose's configuration can be found [here](configuration).

<Callout type="info">

The `omop-lite` container, whose task is creating `omop` schema on `db` and install vocabularies there, will be shut down automatically after successfully done its jobs. The execution time for `omop-lite` may vary depending of the size of the Vocabs folder.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

Docker will mount the `app/api` and `app/next-client-app` directories to its environment, so any changes in the code of the backend or frontend will be reflected in the running application.

</Callout>

### First instances creation

Create some first instances in Carrot app by logging to Django Admin panel `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.

1. You can **log in to the Admin Panel** using the [superuser credentials](#superuser-credentials-setup) you configured earlier.
2. Once logged in, you will be presented with the Django Admin panel.
3. Following this order, fill out the required information to create new instance of `Data Partner`, `Dataset` and `Project`.

### Check-in

You should now be able to access Carrot by logging in at `http://localhost:3000/` using your admin credentials created at step 4.

After log in, you will be presented with `Projects` page.

Try using Carrot by steps in the [user quickstart](/mapper/user_guide/quickstart) to see if Carrot is running correctly. If you can successfully upload a new scan report, create mapping rules, and finally can export the Mapping rules JSON. That's a sign that you have successfully install and run Carrot locally.

<Callout emoji="ðŸŽ‰">Congratulations on your first Carrot running!</Callout>

</Steps>

Since now on, to run Carrot locally, you can just run

```bash
STORAGE_TYPE=minio docker compose --profile minio up -d
```

and access `http://localhost:3000/`.

- To stop the application, run:

```bash
STORAGE_TYPE=minio docker compose --profile minio down
```

**Note**: If you re-run the Carrot-Mapper app, it wiil check if the resources are already created. If they are, it will skip the creation process.

**What next?** Explore and try using Carrot with [user quickstart](/mapper/user_guide/quickstart).
