# Carrot ETL End-to-End Workflow Documentation

This tutorial walks you through the complete Carrot ETL workflow using realistic sample healthcare data. You'll transform patient records, visits, diagnoses, medications, and procedures into the OMOP Common Data Model format.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- Profiled sample healthcare data using WhiteRabbit
- Created data mappings using Carrot Mapper
- Executed the transformation using Carrot Transform
- Generated OMOP CDM-compliant data ready for research

## Sample Data Overview

We'll work with five sample data files representing a typical healthcare dataset:

- **patients.csv** - Patient demographics and contact information
- **visits.csv** - Healthcare visits and encounters
- **diagnoses.csv** - Medical diagnoses with ICD-10 codes
- **medications.csv** - Prescribed medications and dosages
- **procedures.csv** - Medical procedures and tests

## Prerequisites

- macOS, Linux, or Windows system
- Java 8 or higher installed
- WhiteRabbit v1.0.0 or later
- Access to Carrot Mapper platform
- Carrot Transform tool installed
- Python 3.7+ (for Carrot Transform)

## Tutorial Phases

### Phase 1: Data Profiling with WhiteRabbit
Use WhiteRabbit to analyze the sample data and generate a scan report. This phase helps you understand the data structure and quality before transformation.

### Phase 2: Data Transformation with Carrot Mapper
Configure field mappings and transformation rules using Carrot Mapper. This phase defines how the sample data will be converted to OMOP CDM format.

### Phase 3: Data Execution and Validation
Execute the transformation using Carrot Transform and validate the results. This phase performs the actual data conversion and ensures quality standards are met.

## Getting Started

1. Download the sample data files to your local machine
2. Follow each phase in order - each builds on the previous one
3. Use the same sample data throughout the tutorial for consistency
