# Phase 1: Data Profiling with WhiteRabbit

In this phase, you'll use WhiteRabbit to analyze the sample healthcare data and generate a scan report. This report will help you understand the data structure and quality before creating mappings in the next phase.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this phase, you'll have:
- Downloaded and set up WhiteRabbit
- Scanned the sample data files
- Generated a comprehensive scan report
- Reviewed the data structure and quality

## Step 1: Download and Install WhiteRabbit

### 1.1 Download WhiteRabbit

1. Go to the [OHDSI WhiteRabbit releases page](https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit/releases/latest)
2. Download the latest `WhiteRabbit_vX.X.X.zip` file
3. Extract the zip file to your desired location (e.g., `~/WhiteRabbit_v1.0.0/`)

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** WhiteRabbit only works from paths with ASCII characters. Avoid using non-ASCII characters in your installation path.
</Callout>

### 1.2 Launch WhiteRabbit

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/WhiteRabbit_v1.0.0
./bin/whiteRabbit
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
cd C:\WhiteRabbit_v1.0.0
bin\whiteRabbit.bat
```

You should see the WhiteRabbit GUI open with configuration sections.

## Step 2: Configure WhiteRabbit for Sample Data

### 2.1 Set Working Folder

1. In WhiteRabbit GUI, locate the "Working Folder" section
2. Click "Pick Folder" button
3. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the sample data files
4. Select the folder and confirm

<Callout type="info">
  **Tip:** Create a dedicated folder for this tutorial (e.g., `~/carrot-tutorial/`) and place all sample data files there.
</Callout>

### 2.2 Configure Data Source Type

Since our sample data is in CSV format:

1. Select "Delimited text files" as source type
2. Set delimiter to `comma` (for CSV files)

### 2.3 Configure Scan Options

Use these recommended settings for the tutorial:

- **Scan field values**: ✅ Check this box (essential for data analysis)
- **Min cell count**: Set to 1 (to see all values in our small dataset)
- **Rows per table**: Choose "All rows" (our sample data is small)
- **Max distinct values**: Set to 1,000 (sufficient for our data)
- **Numeric stats**: ✅ Check this box (useful for analysis)

## Step 3: Execute the Data Scan

### 3.1 Select Files to Scan

1. In the file selection area, you should see the sample data files:
   - `patients.csv`
   - `visits.csv`
   - `diagnoses.csv`
   - `medications.csv`
   - `procedures.csv`

2. Select all five files for scanning

### 3.2 Run the Scan

1. Click "Scan tables" button
2. Monitor progress in the status area
3. Wait for completion message

**Expected Result:** `ScanReport.xlsx` file created in your working folder

## Step 4: Review the Scan Results

### 4.1 Open the Scan Report

1. Navigate to your working folder
2. Open the generated `ScanReport.xlsx` file

### 4.2 Examine the Report Structure

The scan report contains several tabs:

**Field Overview Tab:**
- Shows data types, counts, and statistics for all fields
- Review the data types detected by WhiteRabbit
- Check for any unexpected data quality issues

**Table Overview Tab:**
- Provides summary statistics for each table
- Shows row counts and field counts
- Verify all five tables were scanned

**Individual Table Tabs:**
- Each table (patients, visits, diagnoses, medications, procedures) has its own tab
- Shows value distributions and frequencies
- Review the actual data values and patterns

### 4.3 Key Findings to Note

As you review the scan report, pay attention to:

**Data Types:**
- Are dates properly recognized as dates?
- Are numeric fields detected correctly?
- Are text fields appropriately sized?

**Data Quality:**
- Are there any missing values?
- Do the value distributions make sense?
- Are there any unexpected values or patterns?

**Data Relationships:**
- How do patient IDs appear across tables?
- Are visit IDs properly linked?
- Do diagnosis codes follow expected patterns?

## Step 5: Prepare for Next Phase

### 5.1 Document Your Findings

Before moving to Phase 2, note:
- Any data quality issues you discovered
- Field mappings that seem straightforward
- Fields that might need special transformation rules

### 5.2 Download the Data Dictionary

You'll need the data dictionary file for the next phase:
- Download `data_dictionary.csv` from the sample data
- Review the field descriptions and OMOP mappings
- This will guide your mapping decisions in Carrot Mapper

## Expected Results

After completing this phase, you should have:

- ✅ WhiteRabbit successfully installed and launched
- ✅ All five sample data files scanned
- ✅ `ScanReport.xlsx` generated with comprehensive analysis
- ✅ Understanding of data structure and quality
- ✅ Data dictionary ready for next phase

## Troubleshooting

### WhiteRabbit Won't Start
- Check Java installation: `java -version`
- Try reducing memory: `export EXTRA_JVM_ARGUMENTS="-Xmx600m"`
- Ensure you're in the correct directory

### Scan Fails
- Verify all CSV files are in the working folder
- Check file permissions
- Ensure files aren't corrupted

### Missing Data in Report
- Verify "Scan field values" is checked
- Check that all files were selected for scanning
- Review error messages in the status area
