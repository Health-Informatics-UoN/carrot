# Phase 2: Data Transformation with Carrot Mapper

## What is Carrot Mapper?

**Carrot Mapper** is like a **translation service** for your data. 

Think of it this way:
- **WhiteRabbit** (Phase 1) told you what's in your data
- **Carrot Mapper** (Phase 2) helps you create a "dictionary" that translates your data into the standard OMOP CDM format
- **Carrot Transform** (Phase 3) uses that dictionary to actually do the translation

**What Carrot Mapper does:**
- Takes your scan report from WhiteRabbit
- Lets you map each field in your data to the standard OMOP format
- Creates rules for how to transform your data
- Generates a configuration file that Carrot Transform will use

**Why this step is important:**
- Your data might call a patient "patient_id" but OMOP calls it "person_id"
- Your dates might be in "MM/DD/YYYY" format but OMOP needs "YYYY-MM-DD"
- Your diagnosis codes might be in one format but need to be in another
- Carrot Mapper helps you specify all these translations

## Overview

The second phase of the Carrot ETL workflow focuses on using Carrot Mapper to create data mappings and transformation rules. This phase uses the insights gained from WhiteRabbit profiling and turns them into ETL configurations that can convert your source data into OMOP CDM format.

## Step 4: Carrot Mapper Setup

<Callout type="warning">
  **Admin Configuration Required:** Carrot Mapper requires initial setup through the admin backend. This includes creating projects, configuring data sources, and setting up user permissions. Please contact your system administrator to ensure the Carrot Mapper environment is properly configured before proceeding with this tutorial.
</Callout>

### 4.1 Access Carrot Mapper

1. Navigate to your Carrot Mapper instance
2. Log in with appropriate credentials
3. Verify you have access to the configured project

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** Carrot Mapper is accessed through a web interface. The project and data source configuration should already be set up by your administrator.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Upload Scan Report

### 5.1 Prepare Files for Upload

1. Ensure you have:
   - `ScanReport.xlsx` from WhiteRabbit
   - Properly formatted data dictionary (CSV format)
   - Required permissions and access

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** The data dictionary must be properly formatted with all required columns filled in. Only the last column can be empty.
</Callout>

### 5.2 Upload Process

  <figure style={{ margin: "0" }}>
    <img 
      src="/docs/Scan_Report_upload.png" 
      alt="Carrot Mapper Scan Report Upload Interface" 
      width="100%"
      height="auto"
      style={{ 
        maxWidth: "800px", 
        border: "3px solid #007acc", 
        borderRadius: "16px",
        padding: "12px",
        boxShadow: "0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)",
        backgroundColor: "#ffffff"
      }} 
    />
    <figcaption style={{ 
      marginTop: "16px", 
      fontStyle: "italic", 
      color: "#333",

      fontWeight: "600"
    }}>
      Figure: Carrot Mapper Scan Report Upload Interface
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

1. In Carrot Mapper, locate the upload section
2. Upload your `ScanReport.xlsx` file
3. Upload your `sample-dataDictionary.csv` file
4. Verify all files are properly loaded
5. Review any validation messages or warnings

**Data Dictionary Format Requirements:**
```csv
csv_file_name,field_name,code,value
Covid19.csv,Symptom,SNOMED,
Covid19.csv,Testtype,LOINC,
Demographics.csv,Sex,F,Female
Demographics.csv,Sex,M,Male
```

## Step 6: Begin Data Mapping

Once you've uploaded your scan report and data dictionary, the system processes the files and makes them ready for mapping. Here's what you do next:

### 6.1 Access Your Uploaded Scan Report

1. **Go to the "Scan Reports" page** in Carrot Mapper
2. **Find and click on your uploaded scan report**
3. **This opens the scan report detail page**

### 6.2 Map Individual CSV Files

On the scan report detail page, you'll see the CSV files from your data. For this tutorial, you should see:
- `covid19.csv`
- `Demographics.csv`

**Let's start mapping:**

#### Map covid19.csv
1. **Click "Edit Table" on covid19.csv** - this opens the mapping interface

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "24px", marginBottom: "32px" }}>
  <figure style={{ margin: "0" }}>
    <img 
      src="/docs/Editing Scan Report.png" 
      alt="Carrot Mapper Edit Table Interface for covid19.csv" 
      width="100%"
      height="auto"
      style={{ 
        maxWidth: "800px", 
        border: "3px solid #007acc", 
        borderRadius: "16px",
        padding: "12px",
        boxShadow: "0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)",
        backgroundColor: "#ffffff"
      }} 
    />
    <figcaption style={{ 
      marginTop: "16px", 
      fontStyle: "italic", 
      color: "#333",
      fontSize: "16px",
      fontWeight: "600"
    }}>
      Figure: Edit Table Interface - Configuring Person ID and Date Event for covid19.csv
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

2. **Set up the key fields** - you'll see dropdown menus for:
   - **Person ID**: Pick the field with patient identifiers (like "PersonID")
   - **Date Event**: Pick the field with event dates (like "Date")
3. **Click "Save"** to confirm your choices

#### Map Demographics.csv
1. **Click "Edit Table" on Demographics.csv** - open the mapping interface
2. **Set up the key fields** - pick the right dropdowns for:
   - **Person ID**: Choose the patient identifier field
   - **Date Event**: Choose the relevant date field
3. **Click "Save"** to confirm

### 6.3 Concept Reuse Configuration

During the mapping process, you'll be asked:

**"Do you want to trigger the reuse of existing concepts?"**

**Choose "Yes"** if you want to:
- Reuse concepts from other scan reports in the same dataset
- Let the system automatically match concepts based on field names and values
- Speed up the mapping process for similar data

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** Enabling concept reuse may make the auto-mapping process take longer to run, but it will provide more consistent mappings across your datasets.
</Callout>

### 6.4 Auto-Mapping Process

Once you've configured both CSV files:
- The system automatically starts mapping each file
- It uses the field settings you just configured
- The process looks at your data and suggests OMOP CDM mappings
- You can review and tweak these suggestions later

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "24px", marginBottom: "32px" }}>
  <figure style={{ margin: "0" }}>
    <img 
      src="/docs/Mapping in Progress.png" 
      alt="Carrot Mapper Auto-Mapping in Progress" 
      width="100%"
      height="auto"
      style={{ 
        maxWidth: "800px", 
        border: "3px solid #007acc", 
        borderRadius: "16px",
        padding: "12px",
        boxShadow: "0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)",
        backgroundColor: "#ffffff"
      }} 
    />
    <figcaption style={{ 
      marginTop: "16px", 
      fontStyle: "italic", 
      color: "#333",
      fontSize: "16px",
      fontWeight: "600"
    }}>
      Figure: Auto-Mapping Process in Progress - Jobs Running
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

**What you'll see while it's running:**
- Spinning orange circles in the "Jobs Progress" column show it's working
- The system looks through your data and creates initial mappings
- This might take a few minutes depending on how much data you have
- You can check progress using the "Refresh Jobs Progress" button

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "24px", marginBottom: "32px" }}>
  <figure style={{ margin: "0" }}>
    <img 
      src="/docs/Mapping Jobs Complete.png" 
      alt="Carrot Mapper Auto-Mapping Complete" 
      width="100%"
      height="auto"
      style={{ 
        maxWidth: "800px", 
        border: "3px solid #007acc", 
        borderRadius: "16px",
        padding: "12px",
        boxShadow: "0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)",
        backgroundColor: "#ffffff"
      }} 
    />
    <figcaption style={{ 
      marginTop: "16px", 
      fontStyle: "italic", 
      color: "#333",
      fontSize: "16px",
      fontWeight: "600"
    }}>
      Figure: Auto-Mapping Process Complete - Ready for Review
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

**When it's done:**
- The spinning circles disappear and get replaced with green checkmarks
- Your CSV files show as ready for review and editing
- You can click "Edit Table" to look at and adjust the mappings
- The system has created initial field mappings based on your Person ID and Date Event choices

## Step 7: Review Generated Rules and Mapping Diagram

Once the auto-mapping is done, you can check out the rules it created and see how your mappings look.

### 7.1 View Generated Rules

1. **Click the "Rules" tab** in your scan report
2. **Check out the generated rules** - you'll see all the transformation rules that were automatically created
3. **Look at the details** - each rule shows how your source data fields are mapped to OMOP CDM fields

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "24px", marginBottom: "32px" }}>
  <figure style={{ margin: "0" }}>
