# Running with Docker

Carrot-Transform is available as a Docker container image, which makes it easy to run without installing Python dependencies locally.

For basic Docker usage with file-based input/output, see [Running Carrot Transform with Docker](/transform/docker/docker_run).

For transforming data from PostgreSQL database to MinIO object storage, see [Transform Output to MinIO](/transform/docker/output_to_minio).
