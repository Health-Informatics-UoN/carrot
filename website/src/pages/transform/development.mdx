# Development Notes

## Using `uv`

We use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing dependencies and running Python scripts.

### What is `uv`?

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a small command line program that invokes other python tools.
There's also `uvx`, a companion to `uv`, which works like `npx` or `pipx` to run packages without installing them to a project.

### Installing `uv`

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation).
It's surprisingly fast to set up.

---

### Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing.
You can run all tests with:

```sh
uv run pytest -m "not skipping"
```

This requires Docker as tests are run against MinIO, Trino and PostGreSQL database engines that need to be running in the background.
This will take a long time.

A shorter selection of tests can be run with just ...

```sh
uv run pytest
```

... which won't use Docker and but will still perform some database tests with SQLite.

### Running from Source

You can run the CLI directly like this:

```sh
uv run -m carrottransform.cli.subcommands.run mapstream \
    --inputs carrottransform/examples/test/inputs \
    --person Demographics \
    --rules-file carrottransform/examples/test/rules/rules_14June2021.json \
    --output build
```

> ⚠️ On Windows, you would need to replace `/` with `^` for line continuation in the terminal.
>
> Or just paste it into a text editor and hit `END` `END` `BACKSPACE` `DELETE` until you've reformatted it into one line, then, paste that into the command prompt

## Deploying to PyPI and CI / GitHub Actions

[The CI file](.github/workflows/uv-workflow.yml) uses [GitHub actions](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-transform/actions) to test the project and (when appropriate) [deploy to PyPI.](https://pypi.org/project/carrot-transform/)
When the CI job runs, it tests and assembles the project.
If the commit being examined is against the `main` branch, then, the project will be deployed to PyPI Test.
If the commit has been tagged with a tag starting with `v...` then the project will be deployed to PyPI Main.
