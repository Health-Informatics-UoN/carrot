# Development Notes

## Using `uv`

We use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing dependencies and running Python scripts.

### What is `uv`?

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a small command line program that invokes other python tools.
There's also `uvx`, a companion to `uv`, which works like `npx` or `pipx` to run packages without installing them to a project.

### Installing `uv`

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation).
It's surprisingly fast to set up.

---

### Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing.
You can run all tests with:

```sh
uv run pytest
```

---

### Running from Source

You can run the CLI directly like this:

```sh
uv run -m carrottransform.cli.subcommands.run mapstream \
    --input-dir carrottransform/examples/test/inputs \
    --person-file carrottransform/examples/test/inputs/Demographics.csv \
    --rules-file carrottransform/examples/test/rules/rules_14June2021.json \
    --output-dir build \
    --omop-ddl-file carrottransform/config/OMOPCDM_postgresql_5.3_ddl.sql \
    --omop-config-file carrottransform/config/omop.json
```

> ⚠️ On Windows, you would need to replace `/` with `^` for line continuation in the terminal.
>
> Or just paste it into a text editor and hit `END` `END` `BACKSPACE` `DELETE` until you've reformatted it into one line, then, paste that into the command prompt

## Deploying to PyPI and CI / GitHub Actions

[The CI file](.github/workflows/uv-workflow.yml) uses [GitHub actions](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-transform/actions) to test the project and (when appropriate) [deploy to PyPI.](https://pypi.org/project/carrot-transform/)
When the CI job runs, it tests and assembles the project.
If the commit being examined is against the `main` branch, then, the project will be deployed to PyPI Test.
If the commit has been tagged with a tag starting with `v...` then the project will be deployed to PyPI Main.


## Release (revised "uv" procedure)

> These instructions use `$NEW_VERSION` as a shell variable. 
> If you're using Windows, then you may need to use `%NEW_VERSION%` to get substitution.
>
> In addition the `$(uvx poetry version -s)` query thing probably won't work.

1. Prepare/update your local copy
    - checkout `main`
    - ensure your local `main` is up to date with the `main` on GitHub
2. Increment the version number
    - `λ uvx poetry version minor`
    - This is the only "not git" or otherwise atypical step
3. Create the branches and commits
    - `λ set NEW_VERSION=$(uvx poetry version -s)`
        - copy it to a shell variable for substitution
    - `λ echo $NEW_VERSION`
    - `λ git checkout -b release/v$NEW_VERSION`
    - `λ git add pyproject.toml`
    - `λ git commit -m "Bump version to $NEW_VERSION"`
    - `λ git push --set-upstream origin release/v$NEW_VERSION`
4. Check/submit the PR in question
    - This needs to be done before the final steps
6. Create a release
    - `λ git tag -a "$NEW_VERSION" -m "Release $NEW_VERSION"`
    - `λ git push origin "$NEW_VERSION"`
    - `λ gh release create "$NEW_VERSION" --title "$NEW_VERSION" --notes "Release for $NEW_VERSION"`
    - This is done after the PR is merged, and on the `[main]` branch; it creates the Docker image
