# Carrot Transform

[Carrot Transform](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-transform) executes the transformation of data to the OMOP CDM, using the mapping rules generated with [Carrot Mapper](/mapper).

Transform is deployed locally within a data partners environment next to the data, where it can be safely ran to transform the data.

It is a Python tool, can be ran from source or installed using pip. As it is a command line tool, it can be deployed inside a data pipeline with ease.
