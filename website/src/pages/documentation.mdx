# Welcome to Carrot Documentation

Carrot is a toolset for helping data custodians transform their health dataset to the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/).

Carrot consists of two tools: [Carrot Mapper](mapper) for generating mapping rules, and [Carrot Transform](transform) for transforming the data using those rules.

The Carrot model separates the mapping and transforming of data, enabling OMOP expertise to contribute to mapping data outside of a data partners local environment. 
This approach enables wider collaboration and sharing of mapping rules, in a safe and secure way.

At a glance, the diagram below shows the functions of Carrot Mapper (steps 3-5) and Carrot Transform (step 7) in the process of transforming data to OMOP CDM.
